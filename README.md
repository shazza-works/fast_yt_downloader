-Info 
This is a simple tool to bulk download a selection of videos from youtube.
When run it will open nano for you to paste all you short youtube url's
after that just hit Ctl+x and the tool will start the downloading.

Will try and get time to add a Play-List bulk download taking only playlist URL as well soon.
